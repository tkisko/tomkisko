The Wave, 3/8/17
</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF"><H1>The Wave, 3/8/17</H1>I WON THE LOTTERY! To hike the Wave. There are 10 winners in the "in person" day before lottery. It only took me two days to win. A bit of luck given that 50 to 100 people enter each day. There is also a four month in advance lottery with many more people entering.
